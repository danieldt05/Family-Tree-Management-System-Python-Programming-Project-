Feature 1 builds a comprehensive family tree system using Python classes.
It lets me store and display relationships such as parents, children, siblings, spouses, grandchildren, and extended family.

Feature 2 expands the family tree idea by focusing on relationships (siblings, cousins) and birthday management.
I implemented classes Person and FamilyTree to organize and search family data efficiently.

Feature 3 combines both of the code used in feature 1 whilst also implementing the average age as well as number of children a person has, if they have any.
